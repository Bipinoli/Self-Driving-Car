# Self-Driving-Car

## Introduction
This this an android app created in Android Studio. It is ment as an UI for the Robot car based on arduino. Robot has to be able to move
from source to destination in the maze following the shortest path. This app allows the user to set the source and destination and roadblocks
and when GO button is pressed it finds the shortest route in the maze and sends the instructions as how to move to the robot car
via arduino bluetooth module.

I have also included the apk file here.
